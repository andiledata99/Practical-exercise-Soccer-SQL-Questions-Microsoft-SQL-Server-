# South African Soccer Dataset – SQL Practice (Microsoft SQL Server)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores a **South African Soccer dataset** using SQL queries to answer practical, real-world questions. The goal was to strengthen my SQL fundamentals, prove hands-on experience with relational databases, and demonstrate how structured queries can uncover insights from sports data.

## ⚽ Skills & Fundamentals Learned

### 1. Data Exploration
- Viewing the first 100 rows to understand dataset structure.
- Identifying columns, data types, and relationships between tables.

### 2. Aggregation & Counting
- Counting total players in the dataset.
- Counting players by team, nationality, marital status, and injury status.
- Summarizing contracts ending by year.

### 3. Filtering & Grouping
- Listing all unique teams in the league.
- Grouping players by nationality, position, and agent.
- Filtering players with contracts ending next year.

### 4. Ranking & Ordering
- Identifying top 10 players with most goals.
- Retrieving top 10 players with highest market value.
- Ranking players by combined goals and assists.

### 5. Statistical Analysis
- Calculating average salary per team.
- Computing average passing accuracy by position.
- Comparing shot accuracy with goals for correlation insights.
- Calculating goals-per-match ratio for each player.

### 6. Data Summarization
- Total goals and assists per team.
- Average height and weight by player position.
- Market value averages grouped by nationality.
